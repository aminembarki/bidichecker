#summary Convenience bookmarklet for running BidiChecker from a button installed on the browser
#labels Featured

[http://chris.improbable.org/ Developer/blogger Chris Adams] has graciously contributed a [http://chris.improbable.org/2010/11/4/google-bidichecker-bookmarklet/ BidiChecker bookmarklet] (thanks Chris!). By dragging the bookmarklet link to your browser's Bookmarks toolbar, you get a button you can click to run !BidiChecker on the current page for ad hoc spot-checking. His source code is hosted on [https://gist.github.com/662454 GitHub].

Due to a minor bug, Chris's code currently always assumes the page being checked is meant to be left-to-right. The only effect is that when checking a right-to-left page you'll see an "Overall directionality not LTR" error message; other than that, !BidiChecker will work as usual.

Unfortunately, the restrictions of this wiki do not allow us to embed a draggable bookmarklet link directly on this page. Until we find a clean way to do that, please go to Chris's site to get the bookmarklet.
